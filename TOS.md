# Terms of Service
Last Updated: October 17th, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services made available by 21 Million LLC (referred to as "we", "our", "21 Million LLC") including services that we provide via the NYM website (nym.bar and any other domain or subdomain through which NYM-related services are provided from time to time, the "NYM Website") and in connection with the NYM Private Messenger applications (the "NYM App"), including Linux, Windows, Mac OS, Android and Mac iOS (collectively referred to as the "Services", which expression shall include any services, or any part thereof, that 21 Million LLC provides from time to time) and any information, text, links, graphics, videos, audio or other material uploaded, downloaded or appearing on such Services (collectively, referred to as "Content").

These Terms and the NYM Privacy Policy form the End User Agreement between you and 21 Million LLC.

## 1. Who can use the Services
Anyone who is not barred from using the Services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction, and is at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority, if older, in any applicable jurisdiction) can use the Services.

By using these Services, you agree to form a binding agreement between you and 21 Million LLC.

If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other entity that is not a natural person, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so and have the authority to bind such entity to these Terms, in which case the words "you" and "your" as used in these Terms shall refer to such entity.

## 2. Our Privacy Policy
Privacy is central to our purpose and mission. For more details, please refer to the NYM Privacy Policy.

## 3. Our Services
Our Services are intended to inform you and educate you about using the NYM application, a private and secure communications app, and to facilitate private and secure communications between two or more parties, within a group, or within a community.

Availability of Our Services: Our Services may be interrupted, including for maintenance, upgrades, or network or equipment failures. We may discontinue some or all of our Services, including certain features and the support for certain devices and platforms, at any time.

### 3.1. Using the NYM Website
The purpose of the NYM Website is primarily to provide you with information about the NYM App and link to download of the NYM App. We have done our best to make sure this information is accurate and up-to-date, however, there may be unintentional errors that may mislead you. Therefore, we encourage you to contact us for any clarifications you may need. 21 Million LLC does not accept any liability for any accuracy or omission.

The NYM Website also enables you to submit your contact details, so we are able to keep you informed about our work.

### 3.2. Using the NYM App
The purpose of the NYM App is to facilitate private and secure communications, without capturing or sharing any account data. It was created for use by individuals who require anonymity and security.

What do we mean by 'private'? The NYM App does not require you to identify yourself or associate your personally identifiable information to use the service. The NYM App does not attempt to gather information or individually identify users through their use of the service.

What do we mean by 'secure'? The private messages you create on your NYM App are encrypted and only the destination NYM user can decrypt the message. The encrypted messages use Nostr's NIP-04 specification and routed from the NYM App through multiple Nostr relay network.

While we make every effort to ensure security, we cannot guarantee interception or decryption using advanced technologies are impossible.

The NYM App is a messaging app, and does not have the ability to communicate with non-NYM Apps or services. Our Services do not provide access to public emergency service providers like the police, fire department, hospitals, or other public safety organizations.

## 4. Our Responsibilities and Commitments to You
We are committed to ensuring the delivery of our Services in a way that is accessible and reliable.

We will not sell or otherwise monetize your personal data or content in any way. We cannot access your data even if we wanted to, as NYM preserves the privacy and secrecy of your messages. See our Privacy Policy for more information.

### 5.2. NYM Content Policy
21 Million LLC exists to build private and secure technology, and defend individuals' rights to privacy and security in the digital world. We are also mission-driven to uphold key democratic, media freedom and human rights principles.

To enable us to uphold our mission principles, we have identified the following activities of NYM as a clear breach of these Terms.

**Violent Behavior, Violent Extremism and Terrorism**

NYM cannot be used:

- to glorify violence, or promote violence of any form (physical, psychological, sexual) against another individual or group, or incite harm or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.

- by organizations, groups and individuals designated by the United Nations as terrorist organizations or terrorists.

**Child Sexual Exploitation**

NYM cannot be used to organize or promote child sexual exploitation. A child is defined as anyone under the age of 18 (or, if older, the age that is defined as the applicable age of majority in any applicable jurisdiction). Specifically, NYM cannot be used to store or share:

- visual depictions of a child engaging in sexually explicit or sexually suggestive acts;

- illustrated, computer-generated or other forms of realistic depictions of a human child in a sexually explicit context, or engaging in sexually explicit acts;

- sexualized commentaries about or directed at a known or unknown minor;

- links to third-party sites that host child sexual exploitation material;

- fantasies about or promoting engagement in child sexual exploitation;

- recruiting, advertising or expressing an interest in a commercial sex act involving a child, or in harboring and/or transporting a child for sexual purposes.

**Extremely Violence and/or Graphic Content**

NYM cannot be used to store or share violent or gory content that is intended to shock or disgust others, or create harm or distress to the person or persons represented in the content.

**Harmful and/or Unlawful Content**

NYM cannot be used for cyber abuse, non-consensual sharing of intimate images and abhorrent violent material.

## 6.0 Monitoring NYM Breaches
Our Services have been created using a privacy-by-design approach which means that it is impossible for us to analyze or monitor your content you create and store on Nostr through the NYM App, or share it with other users.

Communities on NYM, by their nature, are open to the public, routed through the Nostr network, and the content posted and shared through Communities can be monitored. 21 Million LLC does not have the capacity to monitor all Communities; however, we do make a concerted effort to monitor and where necessary moderate Communities that have been created by us.

If you become aware of any behavior or content which you believe may breach any of our terms or principles of use, you should contact support@nym.bar.

### 6.1 Third-party notification of breaches
We may be notified by third-parties of breaches to these Terms. In such cases, the evidence presented by the third-parties will be reviewed by us (or a service provider engaged by us or by the community to perform such review), to determine the severity of the breach and the required outcomes. Any decisions made by our Board will be final.

All notifications, including requests for information or take down notices, will be documented in our Transparency Report that is updated every three months.

## 7.0 Disclaimers and Limitations
**Disclaimers** — YOU USE OUR SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING DISCLAIMERS. WE PROVIDE OUR SERVICES ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS OR OTHER HARMFUL CODE. 21 MILLION LLC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US IS ACCURATE, COMPLETE, OR USEFUL, THAT OUR SERVICES WILL BE OPERATIONAL, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR SAFE, OR THAT OUR SERVICES WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT DISRUPTIONS, DELAYS, OR IMPERFECTIONS. WE DO NOT CONTROL, AND ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, CONTROLLING HOW OR WHEN OUR USERS USE OUR SERVICES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OR INFORMATION (INCLUDING CONTENT) OF OUR USERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES.

**Limitation of Liability** — THE NYM PARTIES WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE NYM PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR TERMS, US, OR OUR SERVICES WILL NOT EXCEED TEN DOLLARS ($10). THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**Ending these Terms** — You may end these Terms with NYM at any time by deleting NYM from your device and discontinuing use of our Services. We may modify, suspend, or terminate your access to or use of our Services anytime for any reason at any time, such as if you violate the letter or spirit of our Terms or create harm, risk, or possible legal exposure for NYM.
